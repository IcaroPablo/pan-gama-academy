Bootcamp banco PAN + Gama Academy
=

A small collection of simple challenges for practicing basic java development.

## About this repository

This repository shows my progress through the classes of `PAN Academy`, an bootcamp made possible by the online platform `Gama Academy` and the `PAN bank`, and it must be taken as an oportunity to get myself introduced to the basic use of some back-end tools used in web development: `Java`, `Spring Boot` and `AWS`.

Each class is followed by a coding challenge and you can check the folders in this repository for each day's challeges separately.

>_Please keep in mind that this repository is not finished yet and it is being continuously improved as the bootcamp goes on_
