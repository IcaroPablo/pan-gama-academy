Bootcamp banco PAN + Gama Academy
=

A small collection of simple challenges for practicing basic java development.

## About this repository

This repository shows my progress through the classes of `PAN Academy`, an bootcamp made possible by the online platform `Gama Academy` and the `PAN bank`, and it must be taken as an oportunity to get myself introduced to the basic use of some back-end tools used in web development: `Java`, `Spring Boot` and `AWS`.

Each class is followed by a coding challenge and you can check the folders in this repository for each day's challeges separately.

>_Please keep in mind that this repository is not finished yet and it is being continuously improved as the bootcamp goes on_

## Usage

#### If you don't have `JDK` installed yet you can download it in the following sources:
- [Oracle's website](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/downloads/)
- [OpenJDK's website](https://openjdk.java.net/)
- [SDKMAN tool](https://sdkman.io/)

>_I'm not gonna guide you through the full process of installation, the internet has plenty of resources for that_

#### If you already have `JDK` installed:

- Download this repository
```console
$ git clone https://github.com/IcaroPablo/pan-gama-academy.git
```
- Import them on your favorite IDE (mine was `Eclipse`)


>_Notice that here you're gonna find some vanilla java projects as well as maven projects with Spring Boot_
>_Vanilla java projects are in the [pan-gama-java](https://github.com/IcaroPablo/pan-gama-academy/tree/master/pan-gama-java) folder
>_Each spring project has "Spring" in its name and its own folder on the root of the repository_

- Be sure to import the Spring projects as a `Maven project` if you use `Eclipse`
- Also sure to run the file that contains the `main` function in each project to see it working
- Your JVM should do the rest ;)

>_Important note: some variable names and sentences that show up in the console are written in portuguese_
